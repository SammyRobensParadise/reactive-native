### NATIVE REACT APP
## This project is designed to explore oppertunities with development in react (which I love) as well as application design principles.

##Whats currently here?
# currently there is just a boiler plate react app created using expo-cli
# I will be working periodically when I have time to create an platform that allows users to map art and content that they have created to locations, and create a "virtual art tour of their travels" users can also upload images but it will nbe designer specifically to handle pieces of art and artistic photography.

## More to come!
